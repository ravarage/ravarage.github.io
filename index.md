<h1>History of Internet</h1>
<p>Internet its a way to connect the whole world to one giant network. It used for connecting computers, servers, phones, consoles etc. it can be used to websites, transferring data, chatting, gaming, getting news, watching video a lot of the stuff, the application of internet are unlimited a lot of stuff made easy thanks to internet, but internet wasnt always like this, every technology has a start, we are going to  talk about it in this report.</p>

    <a class="clearer" id="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
    <p>Every technology has a start, even internet started somewhere, the idea of wireless communication was   born a long when electricity was invented before internet. When you look at history a lot of attempt to make wireless communication have being done even before computer, and when computer become available, researcher started to look for ways to make long distance communication. Internet connection improved a lot from just a wireless connection that started.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <a class="clearer" id="start"><h2>Start of Internet</h2></a>
    <p>The Idea of wireless connection was around before internet. When electricity was invented, the idea of wireless commutation was born, Nikolas tesla the inventor of electricity  he play with the idea of wireless communication , he had  some idea about it, and in years 1930 to 1940 visionary thinkers like Vannevar Bush believed there will be a way that there will be a way to search and access book and media in near future, even before internet the idea of wireless communication and accessible media at request was attempt and vision that will happen in future.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <a class="clearer" id="first"><h2>The first successful attempt</h2></a>
    <p>The first successful attempt that lead to internet started. It was around 1960 when first internet was born, MIT researchers Licklider popularized the idea of an ‘Intergalactic Network’. To do that he came up with a concept sort of concept packet switching method which transfer data electronic data as Licklider popularized, what they developed called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, it based on packet switching that he popularized that made possible on single network communication to connect multiple.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <a class="clearer" id="attempt"><h2>ARPANET attempted to send  its first message</h2></a>
    <p>On 29th October 1969, ARPANET attempted to send  its first message ever  a “node-to-node” communication between two computer (The first computer was located in a research lab at University of California and the second was at Stanford, each one was the size of a small house) The message “LOGIN”, but it crashed the cutting edge ARPA network anyway, The Stanford computer only received  first two letters L and O.</p>

    <a class="clearer" id="most"><h2>Most Important time in internet history</h2></a>
    <p>The 1970’s where a lot of progress have been made. The company Xerox was known for selling printer, they patterned  printer in USA, they were the only company to sell printer in 1950’s and 1960’s, but when the pattern expired, other company such as canon started selling printer in USA, Xerox was looking for a way to make up for the profit they lose after the pattern expired. Xerox made a research lap called PARC, They hired best known programmer at the time, they developed a lot of thing such as Graphical User interface, bitmap, mouse like the one we use today, ethernet, and network computing, they developed  ethernet in 1973 which become internet standard to this day, in that time FTP server was on development  it was method to transfer file between computer and used NTP connection that based on ARPA NET, on the other hand research in MIT was still going and 1973  a MIT researcher Robert Kahn with help of Vinton Cerf developed Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) a communications model that set standards for how data could be transmitted between multiple networks, In 1975, a two-network TCP/IP communications test was performed between Stanford and University College London. In November 1977, TCP test performed between 3 computers one was in US, UK and the last one in Norway, several research centers developed other prototypes of TCP/IP connection centers between 1978 and 1983. Around that time ADSL was developed which was based on DSL a phone technology that have being around 1800 that have being used for phone communication, they used that technology to distribute internet a router provide internet to client which at time it was router was a computer, it forwards network packet back and forth between them. Router was called gateway at first but later they changed the name to avoid confusion.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <a class="clearer" id="Smtp"><h2>Start of Mail server</h2></a>
    <p>In the 1970 there was no shortage of development. We can call 1970 as a year that internet that really started to grow, in 1970 they started mail server as smtp on port 25, the technology that used for sending emails, and first chat room that run on peer to peer connection also appeared in 1973 it was called Talkomatic that developed by Doug Brown and David R. Woolley</p>
</div>
<div>
    <a class="clearer" id="tcp"><h2>The adaptation of TCP</h2></a>
    <p>The adaptation of TCP and moving away from ARPANET. USA Defense and research labs Start to use TCP/IP and abandon ARPANET,FTP server also abandon NCP and start using TCP, and FTP standard as port 21 of TCP, even IBM when they had their property software, they adapt TCP 1983, IBM started offering  TCP to other companies, by the 1991 the whole world who used internet used TCP as standard communication.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <a class="clearer" id="website"><h2>Beginning  of websites</h2></a>
    <p>World wide web started in late 1980’s. The Idea of the internet came from Berners-Lee who gave managers at CERN a proposal for an information management system that used hypertext to link documents on different computers that were connected to the Internet, the proposal at first was declined. Berners Lee teamed up with Robert Cailliau, an engineer at CERN, to refine his proposal, and in 1990 the Englishman’s gave him time to work on the project. First time he called it as project Information Management, later he tried change its name, he tried a lot of names till settling on Worldwide Web.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <a class="clearer" id="improve"><h2>Improvement of internet</h2></a>
    <p>Improvement of internet and website technology improved rapid after first website. Wireless connection started appear around 1991 and it was labeled as 2G connection, that was used for phone communication and it provide internet to phone,2G connection still around till today and widely used around the world till to this day. Berners Lee after releasing first markup language in 1991, it got a lot of revision and improvement, the way internet operate it was clear that internet is technology of future, so it go attention, so a lot of company started to  create 3rd parties software’s, most notable was flash player by Macromedia which bring audio player, video player, software and later on online video games, which improve website flexibility by a lot, and one other was JavaScript which started in 1995,it was programming language that run client pc, providing function to website.in year 1997 first wireless connection appear  as  802.11 WIFI protocol, that was used to disturbed internet wireless in office and work places to computers, let is not forget that VOIP(Voice over IP) was developed in 1999 that used to communicate phone calls using internet. The improvement of the 1990’s was massive.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <a class="clearer" id="newera"><h2>The new era of Internet</h2></a>
    <p>The new era of internet begins after 1990. in early 2000 world begin to adapt usage of internet more house started to use internet, the more people use internet, html is improving by big margin, html 4 released and then  xhtml 1 introduced, flash player was one of the biggest component of internet, since it was property software, it was bought by adobe, it was massive software, but since flash player was property software, that mean if it have bug you have to wait to adobe to fix it, and flash player was heavy it require a lot of bandwidth, CPU power and ram usage, so no longer adobe buying flash player, html 5 was developed, which was more modern, and provide most of flash feature, and around that time even  though online gaming was started in late 1990 ,some Nintendo games offer online gaming, the online gaming start in 2000, site become more modern, most of the world move to online payment for monthly bills such as electricity, online stores, and much more, since demand of internet connection increased faster internet connection developed, for mobile 3G,4G and now 5G is developed and ready to be deployed, on wired connection they start using fiber connection for faster data transfer.</p>
